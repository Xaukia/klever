hi guys
how are you?
this is the beginning of a project, i don't know if it will work, but what really counts  is the intention.
in this project i will try make a game, simple from the ones we play in arcardes.
meybe it will take time, because i'm starting now in programming. 
but i will try to program a game that takes your boredom out and brings that feeling of nostalgia.
i still don't know what the game will be, i will be studying some arcades games to come up with the idea.
